# 🚨 PyPI Package Name Conflict Resolution

## The Problem

The package name **`navien-nwp500`** is already taken on PyPI. This is why your project appears "pending" - you cannot upload to a name that's already claimed.

## 🔍 Available Alternative Names

Based on availability checks, here are your options:

### ✅ **Recommended Names** (Available)
- **`navilink-nwp500`** - Emphasizes the NaviLink service
- **`navien-navilink`** - Brand + service combination  
- **`navilink-python`** - Service + language
- **`navien-nwp500-python`** - Full descriptive name
- **`navilink-client`** - Generic client name

### 🎯 **Best Choice: `navilink-nwp500`**

I recommend **`navilink-nwp500`** because:
- ✅ Clearly describes what it does (NaviLink for NWP500)
- ✅ Shorter than alternatives
- ✅ Focuses on the service (NaviLink) rather than just the brand
- ✅ Available on PyPI
- ✅ SEO-friendly for searches

## 🛠️ How to Fix This

### Option 1: Change Package Name (Recommended)

Update your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "navilink-nwp500"  # Changed from "navien-nwp500"
```

### Option 2: Contact Current Owner

If you really want `navien-nwp500`, you could:
- Check if the current owner is actively using it
- Contact them about transferring ownership
- **Not recommended** - time consuming and uncertain

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

1. **Change the name** in `pyproject.toml`
2. **Update documentation** to reflect new name
3. **Create release** with new name
4. **Users install with**: `pip install navilink-nwp500`

## 📝 Files to Update

When changing the package name, update:
- `pyproject.toml` - Change the `name = "..."` field
- `README.md` - Update installation instructions
- `RELEASE_GUIDE.md` - Update package name references
- GitHub repository description (optional)

## ⚡ Immediate Action Plan

```bash
# 1. Update package name
# Edit pyproject.toml: name = "navilink-nwp500"

# 2. Test build with new name
python -m build

# 3. Create release

git commit -m "Change package name to navilink-nwp500 (navien-nwp500 taken)"
git push origin main

git push origin v1.0.0

# 4. Package will be available as:

```
