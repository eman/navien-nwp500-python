# ✅ GitHub Actions Deprecated Actions Fix

## The Problem

GitHub Actions workflows were failing due to deprecated action versions:

- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → **DEPRECATED** (April 2024)
- `actions/download-artifact@v3` → **DEPRECATED** (April 2024)
- `actions/create-release@v1` → **DEPRECATED** (long-standing)
- `actions/setup-python@v4` → **OUTDATED**

**Error Message**: 
> "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`"

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Updated Action Versions
- ✅ **`actions/upload-artifact@v3`** → **`@v4`**
- ✅ **`actions/download-artifact@v3`** → **`@v4`** (with new syntax)
- ✅ **`actions/setup-python@v4`** → **`@v5`**
- ✅ **`actions/create-release@v1`** → **`ncipollo/release-action@v1`**

### Updated Syntax for v4 Artifacts
The v4 artifact actions use different syntax:

**OLD (v3):**
```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: dist
    path: dist/
```

**NEW (v4):**
```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: dist
    path: dist/
    # For multiple artifacts:
    pattern: "*"
    merge-multiple: true
```

## 📋 Files Updated

1. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**:
   - Updated artifact upload/download to v4
   - Replaced deprecated create-release action
   - Updated Python setup to v5

2. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`**:
   - Updated all artifact actions to v4
   - Fixed artifact merge patterns
   - Updated Python setup to v5

3. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**:
   - Updated Python setup to v5

## 🚀 Benefits

- ✅ **CI workflows now work** without deprecation failures

- ✅ **Better performance** with v4 artifact actions
- ✅ **More reliable releases** with modern release action

## ✅ Status

All GitHub Actions workflows are now using supported, non-deprecated actions and should work correctly for:

- ✅ **Automated testing** on PRs and pushes
- ✅ **Package building** and validation  
- ✅ **PyPI publishing** on tag releases
- ✅ **GitHub releases** with artifacts
- ✅ **Multi-platform wheel building**

**Ready for production releases! 🚀**
