# 🔍 Finding an Available PyPI Package Name

## The Situation

It appears that many navien/navilink related names are taken on PyPI. This could be because:

1. **You already reserved them** (check your PyPI account)
2. **Someone else is working on similar projects**
3. **Names are reserved/squatted**

## 📋 Next Steps to Resolve

### Option 1: Check Your PyPI Account
Go to https://pypi.org/manage/projects/ and see if you already own any of these names.

### Option 2: Try Alternative Naming Strategies

Instead of fighting for navien-specific names, consider:

1. **Functional Names**:
   - `heat-pump-controller`
   - `smart-water-heater`
   - `iot-water-heater`
   - `tankless-controller`

2. **Your Brand**:
   - `emmansl-navien`
   - `emmanuel-nwp500`
   - `eman-navilink`

3. **Generic but Clear**:
   - `water-heater-api`
   - `smart-appliance-control`
   - `iot-heating-control`

### Option 3: Unique Identifier Approach

Add your identifier to make it unique:
- `navien-nwp500-eman`
- `navilink-emmansl`
- `nwp500-eman`

## 🚀 Recommended Immediate Action

Let me help you find an actually available name. Here's what we should try:

1. **Check your PyPI dashboard** first
2. **Try more unique variations**
3. **Consider if this is really important** - the package name is just for installation

## 💡 Important Note

The package name on PyPI doesn't have to match your repository name. Users will install with:

```bash
pip install whatever-name-we-choose
```

But they'll still import with:

```python
import navien_nwp500  # This stays the same!
```

## 🔧 Quick Test

Let's try to upload with a definitely unique name first, then we can always change it later:

```bash
# Temporary unique name for testing
name = "navien-nwp500-test-eman-2024"
```

This will let us:
1. ✅ Test the upload process works
2. ✅ Verify your PyPI token is correct
3. ✅ Get your package published
4. ✅ Change to a better name later if needed
