## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-26

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

#### Packaging & Installation
- **Fixed GitHub archive installations**: Removed setuptools-scm dependency from build requirements
- **Static version configuration**: Added fallback version handling for archives without git metadata  
- **Enhanced MANIFEST.in**: Ensure _version.py is included in all distributions
- **Robust setup.py**: Handle version detection gracefully when setuptools-scm is unavailable

#### What This Fixes
- Resolves `setuptools-scm was unable to detect version` error when installing from GitHub archive URLs
- Enables reliable `pip install` from `https://github.com/eman/navien-nwp500-python/archive/refs/tags/1.2.2.zip`
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing installation methods

#### Technical Details
- Removed `setuptools-scm` from `[build-system] requires` in pyproject.toml
- Added static `version = "1.2.2"` in pyproject.toml  
- Updated fallback version handling in `__init__.py` and `setup.py`
- All tests continue to pass (41 passed, 3 skipped)
