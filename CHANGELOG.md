## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-26

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

#### Packaging & Installation
- **Fixed GitHub archive installations**: Removed setuptools-scm dependency from build requirements
- **Static version configuration**: Added fallback version handling for archives without git metadata  
- **Enhanced MANIFEST.in**: Ensure _version.py is included in all distributions
- **Robust setup.py**: Handle version detection gracefully when setuptools-scm is unavailable
- **Fixed wheel building**: Replaced cibuildwheel with proper pure Python wheel configuration

#### GitHub Actions & CI
- **Universal wheel building**: Generate single `py3-none-any` wheel instead of platform-specific wheels
- **Multi-platform testing**: Validate installation across platforms and Python versions
- **Faster builds**: Eliminated unnecessary cibuildwheel complexity for pure Python package

#### What This Fixes
- Resolves `setuptools-scm was unable to detect version` error when installing from GitHub archive URLs
- Fixes `Build failed because a pure Python wheel was generated` cibuildwheel error
- Enables reliable `pip install` from `https://github.com/eman/navien-nwp500-python/archive/refs/tags/1.2.2.zip`
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing installation methods

#### Enhanced Home Assistant Integration
- **MQTT streaming support**: Added real-time monitoring with `start_monitoring()` and `stop_monitoring()`
- **Automatic data conversion**: MQTT status updates converted to HA-compatible format
- **Fallback to REST polling**: Graceful degradation if MQTT connection fails
- **Production examples**: Complete HA integration patterns with `ha_streaming_example.py`

#### Technical Details
- Removed `setuptools-scm` from `[build-system] requires` in pyproject.toml
- Added static `version = "1.2.2"` in pyproject.toml  
- Updated fallback version handling in `__init__.py` and `setup.py`
- Added `[tool.bdist_wheel] universal = true` for proper pure Python wheel building
- All tests continue to pass (41 passed, 3 skipped)
